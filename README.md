# Project 15 - Javascript Clock

Javascript digital and analogue clocks, switching by clicking on a button.

The page shows both the time and the date, both based on user's default locale, made language-sensitive by using the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object.

Responsive for all screen sizes.

**My very first javascript project.**
